# Danzr
Do you need a self-hosted discord bot that can play music, even from YouTube. Then danzr is the bot you need!

You can try danzr out yourself without installing it, in my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/73fj8ez9nC)

## Installation
### Requirements
- [Java 21+](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
### Setup
Go to the [Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications/) and create an application

Go to the bot tab and press reset token, you will now get a token.

### Running it
To run the bot you download the jar file from the [releases](https://github.com/Blasix/Danzr_Java/releases/latest) page and run it with the following command:

`java -jar danzr.jar TOKEN`

and replace the TOKEN with your bot token.
